CrazyScientist: Ah, a visitor. You look like a strong and brave individual. Would you assist me with a favor?
- Yes
	CrazyScientist: Great, I need you to go down to the sewer and retrieve a container of ooze from me. Be careful though, I think some of my experiments fled down there 
- No
	CrazyScientist: Dang, and I thought you would be willing to help me become the greatest scientist this side of the desert HAHAHAHA!
